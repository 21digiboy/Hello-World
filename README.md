# Hello-World
new repository for fake project
Hi guys! I'm pretty myuch a noob. I want to learn how to code so I can be a cool hacker like Mr. Robot. I've taken a couple classes on C++ a couple years ago but I struggled with them then. I think I have learned a few things since then that will help me to go faster and understand things better now but I still need to spend a lot of time writing code before I get a good handle on things. FOr some reason actually stitting down and writing some code is hard for me to even know where to start. I feel like I could easily spend hours or even a whole day trying to write something and still not be able to get it to work. I want to learn so that I can begin working on some small projects that I have been thinking about. I really think if I could break through to the point that I can confidently get the job done, I would really find it rewarding. I've considered going back to school for a second bachaelors in CS. But I may just learn to code instead and just get busy making some stuff rather than spending a few more years in school.
